/*
  It's generally recommended to let Tailwind's base styles (Preflight)
  handle the default body background, text color, and fonts.
  You can configure these defaults and dark mode behavior in your
  `tailwind.config.ts` file for better integration.

  Avoid setting broad `body` or `:root` styles here unless you have a
  specific reason and understand how they interact with Tailwind.
*/

/*
  If you need specific global styles, add them below.
  For example, to ensure text anti-aliasing:
*/
body {
  @apply antialiased; /* Applies Tailwind's anti-aliasing utility */
}

/*
  To configure fonts, update the `theme.extend.fontFamily` section
  in your `tailwind.config.ts`.

  To configure dark mode colors, use Tailwind's dark mode strategy
  (e.g., `darkMode: 'class'`) in `tailwind.config.ts` and utility
  classes like `dark:bg-gray-900 dark:text-white`.
